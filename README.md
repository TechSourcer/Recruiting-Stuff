## Recruiting-Stuff

++ Under Construction ++

This is all about recruiting and sourcing! Suggestions, ideas and comments are welcome!

I created this also for my teammates since I am also giving inhouse courses in sourcing for our recruiting geeks. So that was the decision to make it also public in order to share my knowledge, so that other people can use it, too! 

In the following sections you will find everything what you need for sourcing. 

Note: The usage of any of these resources are at your ownrisk. Hence I am not responsible for your safety / compliance / relationship or anything else.
