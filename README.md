## Recruiting-Stuff

This is all about Recruiting and Sourcing topics! Suggestions, ideas and comments are welcome!

I created this also for my teammates since I am also giving inhouse courses in Sourcing. So that was the decision to make it also public to share my knowledge about sourcing and recruiting, so that other people can use it, too! 

Note: The usage of any of these resources are at your ownrisk. Hence I am not responsible for your safety / compliance / relationship or anything else.
